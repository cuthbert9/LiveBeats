- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences.

### User Flow
1. **Discovery**: Users land on the homepage and use the "Global Search" or "Quick Links" to navigate to their area of interest.
2. **Engagement**: Users can interact with event calendars, browse artist bios, or compare venue features.
3. **Planning**: For wedding organizers, the "Weddings" tab provides a step-by-step resource discovery flow.

## Solving the Music Discovery Problem
Traditional event discovery is fragmented across social media, venue websites, and ticket platforms. LiveBeats solves this by:
- **Aggregation**: Bringing diverse genres and venue types into a single interface.
- **Transparency**: Providing clear pricing and availability upfront.
- **Curation**: Highlighting featured events and top-rated venues to help users make informed choices.
